# Java 8 Features

Java 8 introduced several important features that enhanced the language and made development more efficient. Here are some of the key features:

1. [Lambdas](Lambdas/README.md): Lambdas allow you to write more concise and expressive code by enabling functional programming in Java.

2. [Stream API](StreamAPI/README.md): The Stream API provides a powerful way to process collections of data in a functional style, allowing for parallel and sequential operations.

3. [Default Methods](DefaultMethods/README.md): Default methods allow interfaces to have method implementations, reducing the need for abstract classes and enabling backward compatibility.

4. [Optional](Optional/README.md): The Optional class provides a way to handle null values more effectively, reducing the chances of NullPointerExceptions.

5. [Date and Time API](DateAndTimeAPI/README.md): Java 8 introduced a new Date and Time API that provides a more comprehensive and flexible way to work with dates and times.

6. [Method References](MethodReferences/README.md): Method references allow you to refer to methods or constructors without invoking them, making code more concise and readable.

7. [Functional Interfaces](FunctionalInterfaces/README.md): Functional interfaces are interfaces that have a single abstract method, enabling the use of lambda expressions.

8. [Parallel Streams](ParallelStreams/README.md): Parallel streams allow for efficient parallel processing of data, leveraging multi-core processors to improve performance.
