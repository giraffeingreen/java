## Introduction

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that organizes code into objects, which are instances of classes. OOP focuses on the concepts of objects that contain data and code, rather than functions and logic. This paradigm is designed to increase flexibility and maintainability in programming, and is widely used in large-scale software engineering.

## Encapsulation

Encapsulation is the bundling of data and the methods that operate on that data within a single unit, or object. This concept is used to hide the internal representation, or state, of an object from the outside. This is called information hiding.

### Key aspects of encapsulation:
- Data protection
- Controlled access to data
- Flexibility to change internal implementation

## Inheritance

Inheritance is a mechanism where you can derive a class from another class for a hierarchy of classes that share a set of attributes and methods. It's one of the most important features of OOP.

### Benefits of inheritance:
- Code reusability
- Method overriding
- Establishment of a class hierarchy

## Polymorphism

Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common base class. It provides a way to perform a single action in different forms and a way to invoke methods of a derived class through a base class reference during runtime.

### Types of polymorphism:
1. Compile-time polymorphism (Method overloading)
2. Runtime polymorphism (Method overriding)

## Abstraction

Abstraction is the process of hiding the implementation details from the user and showing only the functionality. It deals with the outside view of an object, separating its essential behavior from the details of how it actually does its work.

### Advantages of abstraction:
- Simplification of complex systems
- Code reusability
- Avoidance of code duplication

## Composition

Composition is a design principle that states that classes should achieve polymorphic behavior and code reuse by their composition rather than inheritance from a base or parent class.

### Benefits of composition:
- Flexible design
- Strong encapsulation
- Avoidance of tight coupling

By understanding and applying these principles, developers can create more efficient, maintainable, and scalable software systems.
